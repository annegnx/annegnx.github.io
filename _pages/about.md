I am a second year PhD Student in the OCKHAM team at ENS Lyon under the supervision of <a href='https://mathurinm.github.io'>Mathurin Massias</a>,  <a href='https://www.irit.fr/~Emmanuel.Soubies'>Emmanuel Soubies</a> and <a href='https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval'>Rémi Gribonval</a> since October 2023. I am working on learning based approaches for optimization. I previously did a research internship, focusing on sorted penalties for sparse regression, in the same team. I am a graduate from <a href='https://www.master-mva.com'>MVA research master</a> and <a href='https://ecoledesponts.fr'>Ecole des Ponts Paristech</a>. You can find more details on my [résumé]({{annegnx.github.io}}/assets/cv/CV_gagneux.pdf).
